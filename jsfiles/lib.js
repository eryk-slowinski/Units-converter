export const funFacts = ['The units of metric measurements were standardized in 1799. Created in France, the metric system is now an international measurement system. The system is based on the meter (a unit of length) and the kilogram (a unit of mass). The system has changed over time, but it is still the most popular measurement system used in the world.', 'The gram was the first unit defined as a unit of mass. The metric system adopted the kilogram as the standard unit of mass (a gram measures 1/1,000 of a kilogram). The standard unit of volume is the liter. One liter is equal to 1,000 cubic centimeters in volume measurements. The unit of area is the acre.', 'The metric system is based on a measure of 10. This allows conversions from different units more easy--simply moving a decimal point either to the left or to the right. For example, 1 millimeter is equal to 0.001 meter; a centimeter, which is a unit 0.1 larger than a millimeter, is 0.01 meter.', 'After its adoption in 1799, the metric system began enduring some changes. Many countries initially were resistant to the system; it was Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands that mandated its use in 1820. In 1850, scientists worldwide began revolutionizing the metric system. From that time until 1900, the adoption of the metric system grew exponentially, including most of Europe and Latin America.', 'The wide adoption of the policies and standards set forth by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures ensures that the Metric System, and the System of International Units will remain the global benchmark for measurements for the foreseeable future. As a result, there will probably be less and less non-standard symbols for units on the Internet and elsewhere.', `In most of the world, the metric system reigns supreme. Officially known as Le Système International d'Unités, or the International System of Units, it's more simply known the world over by its abbreviated name, the SI. For the general populace in the United States and a couple of other countries, however, the SI is little practiced and largely ignored.`, `Even in countries where Roman characters aren't used, such as Japan and China, you will still see the familiar sight of m, km, g, mg, kcal and all the rest. Capitalization is very important, too, otherwise a milliwatt (mW) could easily be confused with a megawatt (MW).`, `The word "ton" is ambiguous, because it can be used in reference to multiple weights. There is the short ton, for example, which is equal to 2,000 pounds or about 907 kilograms. Then there is the long ton, which is 2,240 pounds, or about 1,016 kilograms. Finally, the word "ton" can also be used in reference to what is commonly known in the United States as the metric ton, which is assigned the official symbol "t" in the International System of Units. That's 1,000 kilograms, or about 2,204 pounds [source: U.S. Metric Association]. You may also see the word "ton" spelled as "tonne" although technically, the correct metric term for 1,000 kilograms is a megagram -- denoted by the symbol Mg.`, `The kilogram is the only base unit whose name includes a prefix. This came to pass because of a series of muddled historical happenings, and many metric purists rue this exception to the system's nomenclature rules.`, `The imperial system is one of many systems of English units. Most of the units are defined in more than one system and some subsidiary units were used to a much greater extent, or for different purposes, in one area rather than the other. The distinctions between these systems are often not drawn precisely.One such distinction is that between these systems and older British/English units/systems or newer additions. The term imperial should not be applied to English units that were outlawed in the Weights and Measures Act 1824 or earlier, or which had fallen out of use by that time, nor to post-imperial inventions, such as the slug or poundal.The US customary system is historically derived from the English units that were in use at the time of settlement. Because the United States was already independent at the time, these units were unaffected by the introduction of the imperial system.`];
